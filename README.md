## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL Server (v8.0 or higher)
- Git
- AWS Account (for S3 and other services)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanyamGarg12/IIT-Ropar-Central-Research-Facilities.git
cd IIT-Ropar-Central-Research-Facilities
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Server (.env)
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

4. Configure the environment variables with your specific settings.

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
# Create the database
mysql -u your_username -p < database.sql

# Run migrations
cd server
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

6. Start the development servers:
```bash
# Start server
cd server
npm run dev

# Start frontend server
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
The project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration. These are stored in the `server/.env` file which is not tracked by Git for security reasons. You'll need to create this file based on the provided example:

Server `.env` file should include:
- Database credentials
- JWT secret key
- AWS credentials
- Email service credentials
- Other API keys

**Important**: Never commit your `server/.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this.

#### Security Measures
- All sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables
- Database credentials are encrypted
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- API endpoints are protected with proper authentication
- File uploads are secured with proper validation
